    Splurty is the spawn of a new found love affair with 'rails.' It's a database-powered quotes generator with a mobile-first design, built with Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS3, GitHub and Heroku.

    <p>
      Chris is a husband and father of two wonderful girls (who take after their beautiful mommy), as well as a web developer, programmer, and licensed psychologist working in the field of clinical infomatics. It may seem an interesting combo to some, but it was an inevitable outcome for him, blending his passions for data and computer science, design, and clinical care. He received his PhD in clinical psychology in 2008, and is currently working on an MS in Computer Science.
